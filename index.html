		<h2>Spark is a new breed of <em>JavaScript library</em></h2>
		
		<p>It is fast and lightweight leaving a tiny, beautiful, footprint within your application. You can learn all about itâ€™s capabilities within the documentation.</p>
		
		<p>Download either the minified or production (unminified) version from the right or the downloads page.</p>

		<h3>Learn by example</h3>
		
		<p>I feel the best way for you to get started with Spark is to see it in action. You may have noticed the tweets on the right sneaking in there, well that was Spark, but try clicking this box below for another demonstration.</p>
		
		<div id='lbe'><p>Pretty cool, if I do say so my self.</p></div>
		
		<p>Impressed? This can be accomplished easily using the <a href='/documentation/animate'>animate</a> and <a href='/documentation/event'>event</a> functions. Play about, try to recreate it. Once you create a nice effect or function, why not turn it into a plugin and share it with other users.</p>
		
		<h3>So what are you waiting for?</h3>
		
		<p><a href='/download'>Download Spark</a>, read the <a href='/documentation'>documentation</a> and maybe even <a href='/documentation'>the Spark guide</a>. Then get coding amazing web apps. Good luck and have fun doing what you do best.</p>
